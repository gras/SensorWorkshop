# 09-DriveSquareUsingForLoop
##Goal:  Use a for loop to repeat common code

**To Do:**
* drive the robot forward about a foot
* make a right turn, as close to 90 degrees as you can
* enclose this in a for loop

**Hints:**
* a for loop looks like this:

```
	for i in range(0,4):
	    # repeated code here

```
