# 08-DriveSquareUsingWhileLoop
##Goal:  Use a while loop to repeat common code

**To Do:**
* drive the robot forward about a foot
* make a right turn, as close to 90 degrees as you can
* enclose this in a while loop

**Hints:**
* a while loop looks like this:

```
    i = 0
	while i < 4:
	    # repeated code here
		i++
```
