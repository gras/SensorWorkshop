##Goal:  Find the correct ports and servo settings 

**To Do:**
* open constants.py 
* compare the analog port list to the sensor wires
* compare the servo port list to the servo wires
* use "Motors & Sensors" - "Servo" page to determine the four servo positions  
* use "Motors & Sensors" - "Camera" page to tune the camera to sense red  
* use "Motors & Sensors" - "Sensor List" page to set the pull up resistor 
* place a tribble where the claw could reach and read the ET value
